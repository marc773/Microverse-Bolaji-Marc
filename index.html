            JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language. 
            It is a small and lightweight language. Inside a host environment (for example, 
            a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to 
            provide programmatic control over them.
        </p>
        <p class="just">
            JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, 
            and a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements. 
            Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional 
            objects; for example:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Client-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser
                    and its Document Object Model (DOM). For example, client-side extensions allow an application
                    to place elements on an HTML form and respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input,
                    and page navigation.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Server-side JavaScript extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript
                    on a server. For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, 
                    provide continuity of information from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file 
                    manipulations on a server.

            You use variables as symbolic names for values in your application. 
            The names of variables, called identifiers, conform to certain rules.
        </p>
        <p>
            A JavaScript identifier must start with a letter, underscore (_), 
            or dollar sign ($); subsequent characters can also be digits (0-9). 
            Because JavaScript is case sensitive, letters include the characters "A" through "Z" 
            (uppercase) and the characters "a" through "z" (lowercase).
        </p>
        <p>            
            You can use ISO 8859-1 or Unicode letters such as å and ü in identifiers. 
            You can also use the Unicode escape sequences as characters in identifiers. 
            Some examples of legal names are Number_hits, temp99, and _name.

        <p class="just">
            You can declare a variable in three ways:
        </p>    
        <p> 
            With the keyword var. For example,
        </p>
        <div class="codeCase"> 
            <code>var x = 51. </code>
                   </div> <br>
          <p>
            This syntax can be used to declare both local and global variables.
          </p>
          
          <p> 
            By simply assigning it a value. For example,
        </p>
        <div class="codeCase"> 
            <code>x = 51. </code>
                   </div> <br>
          <p>
            This always declares a global variable. It generates a strict 
            JavaScript warning. You shouldn't use this variant.
          </p>

          <p> 
            With the keyword let. For example,
        </p>
        <div class="codeCase"> 
            <code> let x = 51. </code>
                   </div> <br>
          <p>
            This syntax can be used to declare a block scope local variable.
            See Variable scope below.
          </p>
      </section>
      <a id="Constants"></a>
      <section class="main-section" id="Constants">
        <header class="main-header" >Constants</header>
        <p class="just">
            You can create a read-only, named constant with the const keyword. 
            The syntax of a constant identifier is the same as for a variable identifier: 
            it must start with a letter, underscore or dollar sign and can contain alphabetic, 
            numeric, or underscore characters.
        </p>
        <div class="codeCase"> 
            <code> const PI = 3.14; </code>
                   </div> <br>
         <ul>
          <li class="list">
            A constant cannot change value through assignment or 
            be re-declared while the script is running. It has 
            to be initialized to a value.</li>
          <li class="list">
            The scope rules for constants are the same as those for let block scope variables. 
            If the const keyword is omitted, the identifier is assumed to represent a variable.
          </li>
          <li class="list">
            You cannot declare a constant with the same name as a function or variable 
            in the same scope. For example:
          </li>
         </ul>
         <div class="codeCase"> 
            <code> // THIS WILL CAUSE AN ERROR function f() {}; const f = 5; // THIS
                WILL CAUSE AN ERROR ALSO function f() { const g = 5; var g;
                //statements } </code>
                   </div> <br>
        <p >
            However, object attributes are not protected, so the following statement
            is executed without problems.
        </p>
        <div class="codeCase"> 
            <code>const MY_OBJECT = {"key": "value"}; MY_OBJECT.key =
                "otherValue"; </code>
                   </div> <br>
